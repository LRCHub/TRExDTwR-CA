All I do is stay focused,
Looking straight forward at the world and beyond
I feel people pulling me down
I feel some pulling me up, I can't get stuck
I just keep moving forward
I got places to go, man, let's go

When the Armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak-hearted weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak-hearted wither and moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you

Hey, the victory's found in truth
Like innocence found in youth
Self-defeat is your own dispute
And, man, you put yourself in your own shoes
Either you're winning or losing
Don't you get it confused
'Cause you're starring in your own movie
Playing of the role you choose, so
Stand up and fight if you know that
You're right and know you will never fail
Tipping the scale and the wind shall
Prevail and the boat shall forever sail
Hey, there ain't no stopping or cruising
Even when you're battered and bruised
Hold down all the sprinklers on Mt. Olympus
My god's tougher than Zeus

When the Armageddon's dark and dread (I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak-hearted weep and moan (I get up and we get it cracking)
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread (I get up and I get it going)
A lot of weak-hearted wither and
Moan (We get up and we keep it flowing)
Only the strong will continue (yeah)
I know you have it in you (yeah, yeah)
I know you have it in you

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
New York to Cali for the money, power, respect
It's a journey, some'll get left behind
'Cause in life you cannot press rewind
Get it right: you only have one first chance
To make one first impression that lasts a lifetime
Reputation supersedes itself
Do you believe in Hell? Babylon greed for wealth
Do you deceive yourself and let your ego swell
And disregard those who most need your help?
Thick-skinned, the dark won't take my soul
Survived spiritual wars, see my welts?
And the evil's felt, but the faith is stronger
I saw grown men fall when I was a youngster
But I clench my fists ready to go against whoever
Tie my Timbs and rise in the end

When the Armageddon's dark and dread (I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak-hearted weep and moan (I get up and we get it cracking)
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread (I get up and I get it going)
A lot of weak-hearted wither and
Moan (We get up and we keep it flowing)
Only the strong will continue (yeah)
I know you have it in you (yeah, yeah)
I know you have it in you

No man live forever, but never say never
Every good he want better, just be a go-getter
And always be clever in every endeavor
The drastic time call for drastic measure
Your girl tied to pleasure from your neighbor since ever
The land and the treasure work for whatever
Just don't be a beggar, the Alpha Omega
Will bless every soul no matter which name you prefer
The immortal stepper believe in every skin
No matter which color they are
Would never let, Him not care which kind of weather
You're destined to rise like the Son of Rebbecca
Don't stop for a second
Every man reckon it sure would be good to be there
Whether Zion or Mecca
When the gates are finally closed
And the saints go marching in

When the Armageddon's dark and dread (I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak-hearted weep and moan (I get up and we get it cracking)
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread (I get up and I get it going)
A lot of weak-hearted wither and
Moan (We get up and we keep it flowing)
Only the strong will continue (only the strong will continue)
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you

I'm a street-lifer always harassed by the C ciphers
Chief like Geronimo with his peace pipe
I emerge from the street life
This for the homies who relate, know what it be like
My QB life takin' a turn to the Louis the Thirteenth life
Twisted and mangled sort of like Bruce Lee life
Cursed with his son Brandon, if that's you and me tonight
I pray our fate's greater
I speak life, I still matter as a rapper, not doubtin'
Even Toni Braxton signed a deal with Craig Cowman
How in the hell am I supposed to stay comfy
When I pay child-support, alimony monthly?
Got Maseratis and Ferraris
Only like a woman who's a rider, but only hos want me
Single life crazy, niggas wives on me
I say stay faithful, they say they man connin'
So I'm stuck with some married woman so fine
Cheatin' while they husband is rushin' on the forty-yard line
Wonder if this is what my ex did the whole time
Good niggas always seem to end up with some hard times
Hope not, if a pimp slippin' in a ho plot
Ain't nothin' to a G in a two-tone drop
Kid, and it don't stop
See a nigga disappearin' with the
Baddest honies in the whole spot, yeah
